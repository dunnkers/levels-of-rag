       "[Document(page_content=\"# How I lost 1000€ betting on CS:GO with machine learning and Python\\nPeople have been using machine learning for sports betting for decades. Logistic regression applied to horse racing made someone a multi-millionaire in the 80s. While fun, betting is a losing proposition for most. The house always wins, right?\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a friend, I thought we could beat the house in e-sports by leveraging modern ML tools like LightGBM. E-sports betting is less sophisticated than football or horse racing i.e. the market is less efficient. There is a lot of online data and unknown teams. It was a space ripe for money-making, or so we thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, I will explain the theory behind e-sports betting with ML: what is an edge, financial decision-making, the expected value and decision rule for one bet, multiple bets with the Kelly criterion, probability calibration and the winner's curse.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, I will explain how we built a web scraper to extract features, developed a probabilistic classifier using LightGBM, defined betting rules using the Kelly criterion, backtested it with a positive ROI, and then lost actual money, with many priceless lessons coming out of it.\\n\\n## Description\\nThis presentation goes in-depth on how to use ML for e-sports betting and the pitfalls one might fall in. More broadly, I try to connect ML with financial decision-making, which can be applied in other domains too (credit, fraud, marketing), targeting data scientists and ML practitioners who are interested in financial applications.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial decision-making is not just about being right (predictive modelling) but also about acting rightly (betting/trading strategy).

Determining tree height from space using Deep Learning and very high resolution satellite imagery 🛰️\\nA case study of how we use Deep Learning based photogrammetry to calculate the height of trees from very high resolution satellite imagery. We show the substantial improvement achieved by switching from classical photogrammetric techniques to a deep learning based model (implemented in PyTorch), and the challenges we had to overcome to make this solution work.\\n\\n## Description\\nThe risk that a tree poses to line infrastructure (such as power lines) is determined by several factors, chief among them the height of the particular tree. The increasing availability of very high resolution satellite imagery makes it possible to use photogrammetric techniques to extract height information from a set of stereo satellite images. By using satellite imagery we can achieve a scale not possible by manual measurement. \\r\\nWe found that classical techniques perform poorly on vegetation, and were handily outperformed by deep learning based techniques implemented in PyTorch. This improvement was not trivial to achieve however, as creating labelled data in sufficient quantity was quite challenging.

       " Document(page_content='# Causal Forecasting: How to disentangle causal effects, while controlling for unobserved confounders and keeping accuracy\\nA lot of industry-available Machine Learning solutions for causal forecasting have a very particular blind spot: unobserved confounders. We will present an approach that allows you to combine state-of-the-art Machine Learning approaches with advanced Econometrics techniques to get the better of both worlds: accurate causal inference and good forecasting accuracy.\\n\\n## Description\\nCausal Forecasting is a very hot topic in the industry with many applications ranging from marketing spending to pricing. Disentangling causal effects from spurious correlations plays a key role when forecasts are used for decision making, such as in the case of pricing. Solutions available in the industry typically rely on Machine Learning methods that use techniques like DoubleML, Transformers, LSTM, and boosted tree algorithms. A common shortcoming of such solutions is that they do not account for the existence of unobserved confounders, such as world events, or other hard-to-measure effects that can bias the measurement of causal effects. We showcase a solution that was developed over the last 3 years that addresses these challenges by combining advanced Econometrics methods with  ML techniques. The case-study will focus on the example of retail pricing, but the solution is broadly applicable and it has been tested in different settings, including airline pricing.\\n\\n## Timeslot\\n2024-07-11T16:05:00+02:00 with a duration of 00:30\\n\\n## Room\\nElse (1.3)\\n\\n## Speaker\\n ### Marc Nientker\\nMarc Nientker transitioned from a successful seven-year academic career in econometrics, where he contributed as a PhD and Assistant Professor, to the business world to apply his knowledge on a broader scale.

       "[Document(page_content='# Computer vision at the Dutch Tennis Federation: Utilizing YOLO to create insights for coaches\\nThrough single-camera tennis match footage, via a YOLO-driven computer vision system, and culminating in actionable insights for strength and conditioning coaches, the Dutch Tennis Federation offers a pathway for creating tennis data and insights. In our presentation, we will delve into technical specifications and algorithms of our system, navigate through the challenges of working with tennis video footage, and elaborate on our approach to actively engage coaches in our co-creation approach. After the presentation, you will have a deeper understanding of the intricate workings behind implementing such system in a competitive tennis environment. All output of the project will be presented on Github.\\n\\n## Description\\nTennis is seen within the community more as a skill sport than a physical sport. In this way, tennis is an exception compared to other ball sports, in which there is a primary focus on physical data (e.g., distance covered or time in specific speed zones). The primary use of data by now is tactical analysis, scouting your opponent, and finding specific tendencies. Currently, this is done by manually annotating events in game videos for further analysis, which can take up to 5 hours per match. One of the bottlenecks of this process is finding the start of a rally; the effective playing time is actually just 20-30% on clay courts and 10-15% on fast courts. This means that a 5-hour match would have just 30 minutes of playing time that needs to be annotated. Hence, automatically finding the start point of a rally and cutting videos into shorter sequences would tremendously speed up the annotation process and would allow scouting of more players and matches. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn turn, we had two goals in the project. First, to create a solution to optimize the annotation process by providing videos when the ball is in play. The second goal was to provide tennis coaches and players with physical data and to stimulate the use of this type of data (user buy-in). For both of these goals, we faced specific challenges we needed to overcome. Event recognition has been achieved in other sports as well as in tennis using computer vision approaches, especially video tracking (trajectories and coordinates of the players). In tennis, the Hawk-Eye system is used in big tournaments to provide this information. By using 10 synchronized cameras, the system provides player and ball trajectories that enable event recognition and the extraction of physical variables. However, due to the costs of using this system and the complexity of installing it, using it in less prestigious tournaments or for training monitoring is not an option. To overcome this challenge, we created a one-camera computer vision system that allows for player tracking and simple event recognition. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs mentioned earlier, the second challenge of this project is the buy-in by coaches, athletes, and the medical team to physical parameters for athlete monitoring and training optimization. To overcome this problem, we opted for an educational and co-creation approach. This entails, in an initial step, a presentation on the usage of physical data in other sports and their benefits. In a second step, we performed semi-structured interviews with potential end-users (coaches, athletes, medical staff, and performance analysts). Based on these interactive interviews, important variables for the end-users were defined. In addition, potential forms of data presentation and visualizations were discussed in order to create a dashboard for the end-users. In doing so, we improved the understanding of the end-users as well as the commitment to the project. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn this talk, we will provide a summary of the general approach of the conducted interviews and how this resulted in an interactive dashboard for coaches, athletes, and analysts. In addition, we provide an overview of the pipeline of the computer vision approach. While using an “off-the-shelf” YOLO approach, several processing steps are necessary. This includes several technical challenges like player and court recognition as well as data filtering. We will also provide an example of how we enriched our pipeline with audio data to facilitate event recognition. All in all, we hope to provide an exemplary approach on how to conduct a data science project in a sports environment in which the conceptual barriers between product designer and end-user are often hard to overcome.\\n\\n## Timeslot\\n2024-07-11T14:00:00+02:00 with a duration of 00:30\\n\\n## Room\\nIf (1.1)\\n\\n## Speaker\\n ### Max Brouwer\\nMax works as Data Scientist for the Dutch Tennis Federation (KNLTB).

BERTopic is a way of Topic Modeling that uses Large Language Models. A high-level overview of how BERTopic works will be presented, together with its evaluation and the application of it on a use case of the Netherlands Red Cross. In this use case, BERTopic supports in getting insights into the needs of Ukrainian refugees as expressed through social media.  This presentation will help in understanding BERTopic and might inspire for other valuable use cases within your own field.\\n\\n## Description\\n510, the Data & Digital initiative of the Netherlands Red Cross, is performing Social Media Listening on Telegram channels of Ukrainian refugees, to obtain insights in their needs. As a result, the Red Cross can direct its aid more purposefully. Obtaining such insights can be a time-intensive task, while in case of an emergency, one would like to initialize aid as quickly as possible. BERTopic has shown to be a powerful tool in quickly obtaining an overview of the discussion on social media. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn this presentation, a high-level explanation of BERTopic will be provided, which is a LLM-based method to obtain topics from a set of documents and categorize them accordingly. Other than basic machine learning knowledge, no further background knowledge is required. Rather than explaining how an LLM works, we will focus on what its task in BERTopic is. Next, we will discuss the evaluation of BERTopic, which is a challenging task, as it is an unsupervised method. Three different metrics are proposed, including an innovative approach that creates a test set with GPT. Finally, the application and results of BERTopic to the described use case will be discussed. This will show the practicality of BERTopic and hopefully inspire for other applications. \\r\\n\\r\\nTime breakdown:\\r\\n- Introduction to the Red Cross use case: 5 min\\r\\n- BERTopic: 10 min\\r\\n- Evaluation: 5 min\\r\\n- Application and results: 5 min\\r\\n- Q&A: 5 min\\n\\n## Timeslot\\n2024-07-11T10:00:00+02:00 with a duration of 00:30\\n\\n## Room\\nElse (1.3)\\n\\n## Speaker\\n ### Nina van Diermen\\nI recently graduated from my master Business Analytics and Operations Research.

What is the current state of the tech in the industry? What use-cases work well and which are more challenging? Let's find out together!\\n\\n## Description\\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a popular technique to combine retrieval methods like vector search together with Large Language Models (LLM's). This gives us several advantages like retrieving extra information based on a user search query: allowing us to quote and cite LLM-generated answers.
